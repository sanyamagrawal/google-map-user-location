This code was written for one of the interview Online test I had taken. Below is the problem Statement.

1. Assume a sample large (50K items) JSON data set (e.g USA users for a site with location information) 
2. Render a Google map, with pins shown for each state (e.g X users from California) 
3. On zoom in, show the pins for each city (e.g X users from Palo Alto) 
4. On zoom in further, show the pins for each zip code. 
5. On zoom out, show the appropriate pins per the zoom level
